# Weather Pattern Analysis and Predicting Weather Metrics in Valencia, Spain

## Overview 
In light of the deadly October 2024 floods in Spain's Valencia region, this project analyzes seasonal trends in the weather from January 2014 to December 2024 and builds predictive models to forecast potential future catastrophic events, mitigate their impacts, and improve overall preparedness of the community. The data is sourced from Visual Crossing API. 

## Key Features
- Analyzed 10 years of historical weather data
- Visualized seasonal trends and anomalies
- Built a machine learning model to forecast weather metrics
  
## How to Use
To use the project, clone and download the repository to your local machine. Install the necessary dependencies. Open the 'Tenzin_Lhamo_690P_valencia.ipynb' file in Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or a compatible local environment.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- json
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Results 
- Temperature: Clear seasonal patterns with higher temperatures in summer and lower temperatures in winter. Predictive model showed high accuracy with an R-squared of 0.91. The evaluation metrics included Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.30°C and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 1.78°C.
- Humidity: Less pronounced seasonal variation with a moderate predictive model performance. Predictive model showed an R-squared of 0.39.
